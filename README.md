# 3d-cube-animation

This is a fun little experiment using **pure HTML & CSS** to create a rotating 3D cube. No JavaScript involved â€” just the magic of CSS transforms, animations, and perspective.

## ðŸ’¡ What I Used

- `transform-style: preserve-3d`
- `rotateX`, `rotateY`, and `translateZ` for 3D rotation
- `@keyframes` for smooth infinite animation
- `::before` for glowing effect below the cube
